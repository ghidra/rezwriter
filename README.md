#Rezwriter

A long time ago, someone had made a "rez" inspired "typewriter" with flash, making the type animate on as you wrote. 
This is a simple recreation of the same idea with the canvas and some javascript.</br>
Written as a toy for my kid. Turns out that he likes to just type on the computer, and this gives him something to look at while he does it.</br>

Requires:
---
The "rad" javascript framework</br>

<ul>
<li>delete key, remove characters<li>
<li>return makes a new line</li>

<li>maybe some graphics and particle effects</li>
<li>options</li>
<ul>
