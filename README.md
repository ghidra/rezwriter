#typewriter

A long time ago, someone had made a "rez" inspired "typewriter" with flash. With Type that animated on as you wrote. 
This is a simple recreation of the same idea with the canvas and some javascript.</br>
Written as a toy for my kid. Turns out that he likes to just type on the computer, and this gives him something to look at while he does it.</br>

To Do:
---

-delete key, remove characters
-return makes a new line
-full screen
-colors
-offset to center, move the type as typed like a typewriter
-maybe some graphics and particle effects
-options
